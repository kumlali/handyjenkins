Put followings files here:
* Key and certificate to access Jenkins over HTTPS
* Public certificates of Gogs, SVN, Artifactory, SonarCube or other services accessed through HTTPS
* Public certificate of proxy server

Sample `https\_key.pem` and `https\_cert.pem` were generated by following [https://github.com/hughperkins/howto-jenkins-ssl](https://github.com/hughperkins/howto-jenkins-ssl).

```
openssl genrsa -out https_key.pem  # creates https_key.pem

openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem
# you need to put the dns name of your website, testweb.local
# for the 'Common Name' question
# other questions, you can just accept defaults
# actually, you can accept defaults for all, will work ok too

openssl x509 -req -days 18250 -in csr.pem -signkey https_key.pem -out https_cert.pem
rm csr.pem
```
